# News-Text-Classification-using-NLP-with-Weighted-RNN

This projects tries to mimick the [paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1909/1909.13077.pdf) and also proposes a further improvement by introducing a new technique called Bi-directional Weighted RNN or Bi-WRNN.  

We initially deviced 3 different models and compare their respective accuracies with each other for News Text classification:  
- Long Short-Term Memory Netwerk (LSTM RNN) | Accuracy: 82.2%   
- Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Netwerk (Bi-LSTM RNN) | Accuracy: 87.9%  
- Weighted RNN (W-RNN) | Accuracy: 89.0%  

We also propose a new algorithm here which combines the characteristics of both Bi-LSTM RNN and W-RNN and achieves a maximum test accuracy of 89.2%, a significant improvement over the maximum accuracy acheived in the paper (85.5%).
